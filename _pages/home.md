Hi! I'm a fourth-year PhD student in Economics at Cornell University. My research interests lie in public finance and labor economics, with a focus on safety net programs in the US. Before joining Cornell, I worked for five years at the [Center on Budget and Policy Priorities](https://www.cbpp.org). 

The preferred pronunciation of my name is LEK-sin ts-EYE.
