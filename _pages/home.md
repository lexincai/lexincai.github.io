Hi! I'm a fifth-year PhD student in Economics at Cornell University.  My research interests are in public finance, labor economics, and the economics of education, with a particular focus on safety net programs in the US. 

Prior to attending Cornell, I worked for five years at the [Center on Budget and Policy Priorities](https://www.cbpp.org/about/our-staff/lexin-cai), a DC-based policy research organization focusing on policies affecting low-income families. 

You can find a PDF of my CV [here](/assets/pdf/cv_lexincai.pdf).

My name is pronounced LEK-sin KAI.
