Hi! My name is Lexin Cai (pronounced *Lex-in KAI*). I'm a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Economics at Cornell University. My research interests are in public finance, labor economics, and the economics of education, with a particular focus on safety net programs in the U.S.

Prior to graduate school, I worked for five years at the [Center on Budget and Policy Priorities](https://www.cbpp.org/about/our-staff/lexin-cai), a D.C.-based policy research organization focusing on policies affecting low-income families.

You can find a PDF of my CV [here](/assets/pdf/cv_lexincai.pdf).
