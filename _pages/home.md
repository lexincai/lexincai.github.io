Hi! I'm a fifth-year PhD student in Economics at Cornell University.  My research interests are in public finance and labor economics, with a particular focus on food assistance programs in the US. Prior to attending Cornell, I worked for five years as a Research Analyst at the [Center on Budget and Policy Priorities](https://www.cbpp.org), a DC-based policy research organization focusing on policies affecting low-income families. A pdf of my CV is [here](/assets/pdf/cv_lexincai.pdf).

The preferred pronunciation of my name is LEK-sin ts-EYE.
