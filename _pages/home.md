Hello! My name is Lexin Cai (pronounced *Lex-in KAI*), a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Cornell University. I am a labor and public economist studying the effects of school meals and SNAP using large-scale administrative data. My dissertation research is funded by the Russell Sage Foundation, Policy Impacts at MIT, and the Cornell Department of Economics.

Prior to graduate school, I worked for five years at the [Center on Budget and Policy Priorities](https://www.cbpp.org/about/our-staff/lexin-cai), a D.C.-based policy research organization focusing on policies affecting low-income families.

I am on the 2025â€“2026 academic job market. You can find my CV [here](/assets/pdf/cv_lexincai.pdf).
