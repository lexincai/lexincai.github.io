Hello! My name is Lexin Cai (pronounced *Lex-in KAI*). I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at Cornell University. I study the effects of school meals and SNAP using large-scale administrative data. My dissertation research is funded with support from the Russell Sage Foundation, MIT Policy Impacts, and the Cornell Department of Economics.

Prior to graduate school, I worked for five years at the [Center on Budget and Policy Priorities](https://www.cbpp.org/about/our-staff/lexin-cai), a D.C.-based policy research organization focusing on policies affecting low-income families.

I will be on the 2025-2026 academic job market.

You can find a PDF of my CV [here](/assets/pdf/cv_lexincai.pdf).
