Hi! I'm a fifth-year PhD student in Economics at Cornell University.  My research interests are in public finance, labor economics, and the economics of education, with a particular focus on safety net programs in the US. Prior to attending Cornell, I worked for five years as a Research Analyst at the [Center on Budget and Policy Priorities](https://www.cbpp.org), a DC-based policy research organization focusing on policies affecting low-income families. A PDF of my CV is [here](/assets/pdf/cv_lexincai.pdf).

My name is pronounced LEK-sin ts-EYE. The <b>ts</b> sound is pronounced like in i<b>ts</b>, ca<b>ts</b>, and ha<b>ts</b>.
